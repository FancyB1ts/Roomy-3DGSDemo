## System Orchestration

### MousePlacementManager - Central Orchestrator

The `MousePlacementManager` serves as the primary conductor for all furniture interactions, managing the complete furniture lifecycle through a finite state machine:

```csharp
public enum PlacementState { 
    Idle,           // Ready for new interactions
    Creating,       // Placing new furniture from prefab
    Placed,         // Furniture ready for user interaction
    Moving,         // Dragging existing furniture
    WaitPointerUp,  // Transition state
    waitingForUI    // UI panel active
}
```

#### Key Responsibilities
- **Furniture Creation**: Instantiates furniture from `prefabArray` via `CreateObject(id)`
- **Input Coordination**: Manages mouse/touch input with priority-based conflict resolution
- **State Management**: Orchestrates transitions between placement, selection, and movement
- **Collision Detection**: Real-time overlap checking with visual feedback
- **UI Integration**: Coordinates with `FurnitureUIController` for per-furniture interfaces

#### Interaction Flow Orchestration
1. **Creation Flow**: UI Button ‚Üí `CreateObject()` ‚Üí State: Creating ‚Üí Follow mouse ‚Üí Place ‚Üí State: Placed
2. **Selection Flow**: Click furniture ‚Üí Tap detection ‚Üí Short tap: DataUI / Long press: Movement
3. **Movement Flow**: Long press ‚Üí State: Moving ‚Üí Drag with collision feedback ‚Üí Release ‚Üí State: Placed

### FurnitureUIController - Per-Furniture UI Management

Each furniture instance has its own `FurnitureUIController` that manages three distinct UI states:

- **RotationUI**: Visual feedback during hover with scroll wheel rotation
- **MovementUI**: Visual indicators during drag operations  
- **DataUI**: Dimension input panel with smart positioning

#### UI Coordination with MousePlacementManager
```csharp
// MousePlacementManager triggers UI based on interaction type
if (tapTimer <= tapThreshold)
{
    uiController.EnableDataUI(screenPosition);     // Short tap
}
else if (tapTimer > tapThreshold)
{
    uiController.EnableMovementUI();               // Long press
}
```

#### Smart UI Positioning
The DataUI implements intelligent positioning to prevent off-screen clipping:
- **Anchor Point**: Exact click coordinates
- **Content Offset**: +120px right, +65px up from click
- **Boundary Detection**: Auto-adjusts if content would clip off-screen

## Input Priority System

The system implements a three-tier priority hierarchy to prevent input conflicts:

1. **Highest Priority**: UI Elements (Unity EventSystem)
2. **Medium Priority**: Furniture Objects (MousePlacementManager)
3. **Lowest Priority**: Camera Controls (CameraInputManager)

### Cross-Platform Input Handling
- **Desktop**: Mouse clicks, scroll wheel rotation, drag operations
- **Mobile**: Touch gestures, tap/long-press detection, single-finger interactions
- **Unified Logic**: Both platforms feed into the same interaction system

## Integration Systems

### 27 Slicer Integration
- **Real-time Scaling**: `FurnitureDimensionController` connects UI inputs to `SlicerController`
- **Ground Anchoring**: Automatic position adjustment to keep furniture grounded
- **Dimension Conversion**: 1 Unity unit = 100 centimeters for real-world measurements

### Floorplan System Integration
- **Automatic Activation**: Polygon outlining starts after floorplan upload
- **Scale Calculation**: Room dimensions establish real-world scale for entire scene
- **React Bridge**: WebGL communication for floorplan upload and processing

### HTMLBuilder - Automated WebGL Deployment
- **Post-Build Integration**: Automatically runs via `[PostProcessBuild]` callback after WebGL builds
- **HTML Generation**: Replaces Unity's default HTML with React-integrated version
- **Component Management**: Copies React components from `Assets/WebComponents/` to build folder
- **Background Support**: Optional background images with responsive positioning
- **Build Info Extraction**: Uses regex parsing to extract Unity build parameters
- **Backup System**: Creates `index_original.html` backup before replacing main file
- **Manual Tools**: Unity menu options for custom HTML generation and force regeneration

### Data Persistence
- **Session Management**: Complete scene state serialization to JSON
- **Cloud Storage**: Supabase integration for cross-device access
- **Local Export**: Development-mode PNG export for ML training

## Key Features

### Smart Collision System
- **OverlapBox Detection**: Scaled collider checking with 0.85x scale factor
- **Visual Feedback**: Invalid placement material overlay
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous collision checking during movement

### Rotation System
- **Scroll-based Rotation**: 11.25¬∞ increments with rate limiting (13 scrolls/sec max)
- **Angle Snapping**: Automatic alignment to precise angles
- **Visual Feedback**: RotationUI appears during hover interactions

### Dimension Control
- **Real-time Scaling**: Live dimension updates via input fields
- **Metric System**: Centimeter-based input with automatic conversion
- **Proportional Scaling**: Maintains furniture proportions during dimension changes
